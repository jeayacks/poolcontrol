# Home assistant integration

This is my own integration of the pool controller into Home Assistant.
Please visit [Home assistant web site](https://www.home-assistant.io/) for complete presentation of home assistant.

## Integrate the pool controller

Declaration of my remote pool controller using REST commands.

```yml
sensor:
    # Read all the statuses in 1 http REST query (every 20 seconds)
  - platform: rest
    name: swimming_pool_rpi
    resource: http://192.xxx.xxx.xxx/api/v1/status
    json_attributes:
      - status
      - waterTemperature
      - poolTemperature
      - airTemperature
      - poolTemperatureMinOfTheDay
      - poolTemperatureMaxOfTheDay
      - poolTemperatureDecision
      - pumpingDurationPerDayInHours
      - pump
      - pumpForceOff
      - pumpForceOn
      - chlorineInhibition
      - phRegulationInhibition
      - watering
      - swimmingPoolLight
      - deckLight
    value_template: "{{ value_json.pump }}"
    scan_interval: 20

rest_command:
  swimming_pool_rpi_switch_on:

    method: POST
    payload: '{"active": true}'
    content_type: application/json
    verify_ssl: false

  swimming_pool_rpi_switch_off:

    method: POST
    payload: '{"active": false}'
    content_type: application/json

```




## Automations and manual forcings

Allow to force ON or OFF the pumping system during a specified amount of time.

```yml
input_number:
  # Use either to force ON or OFF the pump during the specified duration
  swimming_pool_pump_manual_duration:
    name: Manual forcing duration (h)
    initial: 2
    min: 1
    max: 36
    step: 1
    mode: box

automation:
  - alias: Switch off lights at 3h00AM
    initial_state: true
    trigger:
      platform: time
      at: "03:00:00"
    action:
      - service: switch.turn_off
        entity_id: switch.swimming_deck_light
      - service: switch.turn_off
        entity_id: switch.swimming_pool_light

  - alias: Pool - Disable manual ON forcing
    initial_state: true
    trigger:
      platform: state
      entity_id: switch.swimming_pool_pump_manual_force_on
      to: "on"
      for:
        hours: "{{ states('input_number.swimming_pool_pump_manual_duration')|int }}"
    action:
      service: switch.turn_off
      entity_id: switch.swimming_pool_pump_manual_force_on

  - alias: Pool - Disable manual OFF forcing
    initial_state: true
    trigger:
      platform: state
      entity_id: switch.swimming_pool_pump_manual_force_off
      to: "on"
